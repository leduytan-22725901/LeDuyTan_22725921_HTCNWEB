        <div>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</div>
        <div>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. </div>
        <div>There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, Jean Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of </div>
            <div>physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician </div>
            <div> of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and </div>
            <div> astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) </div>
            <div> remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a</div>
            <div> une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories</div>
            <div>of the time.</div>
            <div>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were </div>
            <div>introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. </div>
            <div>Euler's formula</div>
            <div> cos(x) + isin(x) = e (ix)</div>
            <div>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, </div>
            <div>it's easy to derive the equation</div>
            <div>e(pi i) + 1 = 0 </div>
            <div>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, pi, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</div>
            <div>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the </div>
            <div>annals of mathematics.</div>
