    <div>II  ⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>
    <div>Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the </div>
    <div>filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds </div>
    <div>detracted from the overall flavor. -- Reviewed on Sep. 1, 2010 by GLENDACHEF.</div>
    <div>III ⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>
    <div>Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert</div>
    <div>- I'll be making it again for the holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.</div>
